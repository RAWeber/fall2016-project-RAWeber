# Tower Defense Game [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cpe305/fall2016-project-RAWeber.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cpe305/fall2016-project-RAWeber)

For my CPE-305 class I created a tower defense game.
The game was created using libgdx and is supported on desktop and android.
The game involves players placing towers on a grid in order to defeat waves of oncoming enemies.
