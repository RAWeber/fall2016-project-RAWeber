The game was created using libgdx and is supported on desktop and android. The game involves players placing towers on a grid in order to defeat waves of oncoming enemies.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-RAWeber/blob/master/images/TowerStore.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## Main Features\r\n- Grid System\r\n  - Path logic\r\n  - Tower squares\r\n- Tower System\r\n  - 4 different towers\r\n  - 2 types of tower attacks\r\n  - Tower Store\r\n- Enemy System\r\n  - 3 different enemies\r\n  - Random enemy spawner\r\n\r\n## Main Design Patterns\r\n- Strategy Pattern  \r\n  - Using this pattern allowed me to interchange tower attacks, allowing easy creation of new towers. Additionally this allows for easy extension of the tower logic, as towers will be able to function with new attack types. This pattern was used in:\r\n  - TowerAttack\r\n- Singleton Pattern\r\n  - Using this pattern ensured that only one instance of key components was present at any time. This pattern also allowed easy access to the main components without the need to pass references among components. This pattern was used in:\r\n    - MapGrid\r\n    - Spawner\r\n    - TowerStore\r\n\r\n## What I Liked About My Design\r\n\r\n## Key Takeaway From Project\r\n\r\n\r\n**Support or Contact**  \r\n@RAWeber  \r\nRAWeber95@gmail.com\r\n",
